It occured to me after a recent consult for a rather aged Caucasian female with a minimally impacted femorl neck fracture. Obviously, she needs surgical management; I stepped in to ensure she had adequate glycemic control for her long-standing untreated diabetes. I put her on a sliding scale insulin. Her HTN is reasonably well controlled, so we\u0026rsquo;ll keep her on home meds. Pain management per orthopedics of course.\nJonathon Taylor, Not a Doctor ","date":"1 August 1011","permalink":"/","section":"Super Senior","summary":"New Album Out Soon!","title":"Super Senior"},{"content":"","date":"1 August 1011","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
